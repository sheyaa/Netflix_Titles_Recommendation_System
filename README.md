# Netflix_Titles_Recommendation_System

This repository focuses on developing a content-based recommendation system for TV shows and movies using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). TF-IDF evaluates the importance of a word in a document relative to the entire dataset and it is one of the most commonly used methods for coverting text into numerical vectors. Text-based similarity is an effective approach for building content-based recommendation systems, particularly when working with textual data like TV shows and movies descriptions. The goal of this project is to allow the user input a tv show or movie of their choice into the recommendations variable and receive the top 5 recommendaded titles as a result.

For this project, I am using a sample dataset of TV shows and movies avaliable on Netflix as of 2019, sourced from Kaggle<>. The dataset contains multiple features such as:

* Duration minutes
* Duration seasons
* Type (TV show or movie)
* Date added
* Release year
* Rating
* Discription
* Show ID
